# Start contributing

This is an intro how to start fixing or adding features

This project is written in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). It's a single page application and it was initialized with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

Some of the extensively used libraries are

- [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) for managing html forms
- redux with [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), and [rtk-query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview) to manage application-wide state, and api calls, respectively
- [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for application routing

They typically have a good documentation which is worth reading when something is unclear.

## File structure

Please also refer to [Style guide](style-guide.md)

### A good starting point

The app starting point is `src/index.tsx`. Some libraries are set up here, and the rest of the app is imported here.

But at first, it may be more relevant for you to start at `src/App.tsx`. You'll find application-wide routing here. Page layouts and pages are imported here, so you can use it as a code crossroad.

[Run the app](../README.md#developer-quickstart), try changing something &mdash; and see what happens...

### Files and folders

- all the app code is in `src/`
- public stuff is in `public/`
- and some configurations are in the root. `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` might be the most important

Within the `src/`, you may find the following structure:

- `pages/`, `org/pages` and `user/pages` - routing pages
- `layout/` - components related to app layout and main routing outlets
- `components/` - reusable components
- `utils/` - helper functions
- `styles/` - scss stylesheets that are not bound to any particular tsx component
- `hooks/` - reusable component logic extracted in the form of react hooks
- `features/` and `app/` - redux stuff
- `app/services/` - connection to [api](api.md)
- `assets/` - stuff that's not code - images, icons, fonts etc...

## API

Go to [api.md](api.md)

## IDE

We used Visual Studio Code to write this project, and there is a config for it here already, but you can of course use any other IDE.

For `vscode`, you may find the following extensions useful:

- `dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`
- `csstools.postcss`
- `esbenp.prettier-vscode`
- TypeScript language support seems to be included by default
